    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my den. This site is still under construction, but should be ready in the near future. 
      This is going to be the new home for my various works, including the Green Lion Podcast, the Sigil 
      Arcanum Tarot, as well as some blog posts, fiction, poetry, and even graphic design and visual art.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h1>The Green Lion Podcast</h1>
    <p>
      The current home for the Green Lion Podcast is greenlionpodcast.sounder.fm, but the new home will 
      be greenlionpodcast.com. I envision this including an RSS feed, where I will post all the freshly 
      hosted episodes. This site will also include a built in audio player, and links to popular Podcast 
      aggregators like Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and many more.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h1>The Sigil Arcanum Tarot</h1>
    <p>
      After a successful Kickstarter campaign, I was able to print, assemble, and distribute the Sigil 
      Arcanum Tarot. This unique deck of cards takes a very different approach to the symbols in the cards. 
      Each card is made up of the elemental, planetary, and zodiacal symbols present in that card's history,
      as well as symbolic representations and sigils made of the philosophical ideas in each card.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h1>Writing</h1>
    <p>
      Throughout my life I've dabbled with all kinds of written works. I have written short stories, and a 
      short novel called "It's Just a Room". I've written lots of Poetry, most of which is terrible, and I've 
      spent a lot of time writing down my thoughts and musings on various things; some of those take the form 
      of essays and articles, some are more like blog posts, and some of those have become episodes of my 
      podcast.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h1>Design</h1>
    <p>
      For about a decade I have been practicing graphic design, and my love for the visual arts has taken many 
      forms, from sketches and inked drawings, to paintings, to digital illustration, my tarot deck, and others. 
      This section of the site will be a gallery featuring the stuff I've made which I like the most.
